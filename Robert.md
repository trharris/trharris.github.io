## Experience

###### Postdoctoral Research Scholar 2014 to present

* Supervisors: W. Rhett Davis, Ph.D. and Paul Franzon, Ph.D.
* Funding: DARPA Agency reference number W911NF-13-1-0076, Microsystems Tech-
nology Office “Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration”

Development of CAD capabilities for the Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration
(DAHI) process, which integrates CMOS, GaN, and InP semiconductors into the same IC.
Capabilities are being expanded to mitigate design issues with material and thermal con-
siderations. Analysis of results, support of customers of a multi-user wafer project, and
validation measurements are performed. Writing scientific publications, and presenting re-
sults to the funding agency.


###NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow 2011 to 2013

####Dot Metrics Technologies, Inc., Charlotte, NC

* Supervisor: Jennifer Pagan, Ph.D.
* Funding: NSF and ASEE grant #IIP-1059286, “Ultraviolet Elimination of Biological Con-
taminants using a Highly Efficient LED System”

Worked as part of a team to introduce the UV Pearl, the world’s first commercially available
flowing water UV LED disinfection system. Involved in the design of the UV Pearl, including
the mechanical, electrical, optical, and fluid dynamic engineering. Designed a thermally
managed UV radiation source module. Delegated work to machinists and engineering con-
sultants in order to complete the project. Wrote publications, reports, and proposals. LED
device characterization, binning, wire bonding, and package design. Designed experiments
for system performance and lifetime enhancement. Production build and troubleshooting of
fluid disinfection units and UV sources.

###Graduate Research Assistant June 2007 to May 2011

####North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC

* Adviser: Michael Steer, Ph.D.
* Funding: NSF Grant 643700, DARPA agreement FA8650-04-C-7127 managed by the
Air Force Research Lab.
Investigated electrothermal modeling of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs). Ad-
vancements in the state of the art in simulation were made through this work. Produced the
world’s first full fidelity three-dimensional electrothermal time transient simulations, which
were validated through real world measurements of 3D-ICs. Invented the method of arti-
ficial time compaction for rapid electrothermal simulation. Assisted in construction of an
anechoic chamber for electrical and acoustic probing of materials.
